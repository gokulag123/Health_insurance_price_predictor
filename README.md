# Health_insurance_price_predictor
Data Analysis and Created Regression Machine learning Model

In this project Iam trying to analyze the Health_insurance_cost dataset and with thorough data analysis and visualisation to
get the deep insights from the data.
Also create a machine learning model that can predict the health_insurance_price.

The dataset have these columns: 'age', 'gender', 'BMI', 'Children', 'smoking_status', 'location','health_insurance_price'.

# Outputs:
From Analysis it was clear that smoking_status holds a great impact on Health insurance price.

Among all the Regression models RandomForest and ElasticNet Regression models were performing better.
